# my project list 
## 1.  re-meal web blog
### https://www.re-meal.com
### frontend code : https://github.com/yeongjaelee/remeal-frontend
### backend code : https://github.com/yeongjaelee/remeal-backend
### (1) Inspiration behind this web blog <br/>
my senior coworker's desire to start his own business related to the keto diet and create a community around it.<br/>
When he approached me to join the project, I wholeheartedly accepted and took the initiative to lead the development efforts, leveraging the skills I was eager to enhance.<br/>
The experience of building this web blog on my own was gratifying, as I could see the positive impact of my programming skills in creating a platform that promotes healthy eating and wellness.<br/>
The experience of building the web blog alone reinforced my passion for continuous improvement and reinforced my confidence in my development abilities.<br/>

### (2) skill stacks <br/>
- frontend : next 13 typescript <br/>
- backend : django python <br/>

## 1. full stack todo list (only with sveltekit, drizzle, postgresql)
### code : https://github.com/yeongjaelee/sveltekit_fullstack_practice
### (1) Inspiration <br/>
I've heard that with frontend frameworks that support server-side rendering, such as Next.js and Svelte Kit, <br/>
it's possible to create a web page without having to distribute frontend and backend separately. <br/>
With this full-stack project, my aim is to understand how it works and determine whether it's a better approach than distributing frontend and backend separately. <br/>
I'm starting this project out of curiosity because I'm always interested in acquiring new skills <br/>

### (2) skill stacks <br/>
- full stack framework : sveltekit, typescript <br/>
- database : postgresql
- database connectivity : drizzle (typescirpt ORM) https://orm.drizzle.team/
