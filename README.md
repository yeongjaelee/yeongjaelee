# my project list 
## 1.  re-meal web blog
(1) Inspiration behind this web blog
my senior coworker's desire to start his own business related to the keto diet and create a community around it. 
When he approached me to join the project, I wholeheartedly accepted and took the initiative to lead the development efforts, leveraging the skills I was eager to enhance. 
The experience of building this web blog on my own was gratifying, as I could see the positive impact of my programming skills in creating a platform that promotes healthy eating and wellness.  
The experience of building the web blog alone reinforced my passion for continuous improvement and reinforced my confidence in my development abilities.
